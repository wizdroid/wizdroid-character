USAGE GUIDE

Step 1: Prepare Your Reference Images

You'll need 2-4 reference images depending on your editing goals:

1. Subject Image (Image 1): The person whose face/identity you want to preserve
2. Clothing Reference (Image 2): Outfit you want to transfer
3. Pose Reference (Image 3): Body position and angles to copy
4. Style Reference (Image 4): Artistic style, colors, and rendering technique

Step 2: Load Images

- Subject: Load your main character image
- Outfit: Load the clothing reference
- Pose: Load the pose reference image
- Blank Face Subgraph: Processes images to remove faces for cleaner references

Step 3: Configure Character Edit Node

The 🧙 Wizdroid: Character Edit node is the heart of the workflow:

Basic Settings:
- Retain Face: enabled (keeps subject identity)
- Gender: male/female/none
- Input Image Index: 1 (subject image)

Camera Settings:
- Azimuth: Camera horizontal angle (front view, side view, etc.)
- Elevation: Camera vertical angle (eye-level, high-angle, etc.)
- Distance: Shot distance (close-up, medium shot, etc.)

Character Traits:
- Body Type: athletic, slim, curvy, etc.
- Skin Tone: fair, medium, dark, etc.
- Eye Color: blue, brown, green, etc.
- Hairstyle: long wavy, short bob, buzz cut, etc.

Dynamic Reference Images:
Use the UI buttons to manage reference images:

- ➕ Add Reference Image: Adds a new reference entry
- ➖ Remove Last Reference: Removes the last entry

For each reference:
- Image Index: Which input image (2, 3, 4...)
- Reference Type:
  - clothing: Strict outfit transfer
  - pose: Body position and limb placement
  - background: Environment and lighting
  - style: Artistic style and aesthetics

Step 4: Model Setup

For Qwen Image Edit:
- Checkpoint: Qwen-Rapid-AIO-NSFW-v23.safetensors
- LoRA: qwen-image-edit-2511-multiple-angles-lora.safetensors
- LoRA Strength: 0.8-1.0

For Flux Kontext:
- Use Flux.1-dev base model
- Enable Kontext mode
- Adjust guidance scale as needed

Step 5: Generate

1. Set your seed or use random
2. Adjust denoising strength (0.8-1.0 for editing)
3. Click Queue to generate
4. View results in the Save Image node

GENERATED PROMPT EXAMPLES

Basic Character Edit:
Use image 1 as subject reference for face and identity.
Use image 2 STRICTLY as clothing reference — apply this outfit exactly, no creative changes.
Use image 3 as pose reference — copy body position, angles, and limb placement precisely.
<sks> front view, eye-level shot, medium shot. A female, average build. neutral expression

With Style Transfer:
Use image 1 as subject reference for face and identity.
Use image 2 STRICTLY as clothing reference — apply this outfit exactly, no creative changes.
Use image 3 as pose reference — copy body position, angles, and limb placement precisely.
Use image 4 as style reference — replicate the artistic style, color palette, rendering technique, and visual aesthetics exactly.
<sks> front view, eye-level shot, medium shot. A female, average build, fair skin, blue eyes, long wavy hair. neutral expression. photorealistic style

ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

Reference Image Processing

The workflow includes a Blank Face subgraph that:
- Detects faces using YOLOv8
- Creates masks to remove faces from reference images
- Ensures cleaner outfit and pose references

Pose Detection

Uses OpenPose preprocessor for accurate pose reference extraction.

Camera Control

The <sks> token controls the LoRA for multi-angle positioning:
- Azimuth: 8 positions (front, front-right, right, etc.)
- Elevation: 4 positions (low-angle, eye-level, high-angle, overhead)
- Distance: 3 positions (close-up, medium shot, long shot)
