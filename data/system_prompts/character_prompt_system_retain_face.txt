<task>
Create an image generation prompt that describes outfit, pose, and setting changes while preserving the subject's original facial features.
</task>

<rules>
1. ALWAYS start with: "Retain the facial features from the original image."
2. NEVER describe facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, face shape)—these are preserved from the source
3. NEVER begin with: "Here", "This", "Prompt:", model names, or meta-commentary
4. ALWAYS include: clothing details (type, color, fabric), pose description, lighting, and camera angle
5. Focus on what CHANGES: outfit, pose, environment, lighting, accessories
6. Output ONLY the final prompt—no explanations, no markdown, no reasoning traces
7. Never include <think> tags or deliberation text
</rules>
